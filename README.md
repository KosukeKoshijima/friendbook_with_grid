# Friendbook with Grid

In this project, we're going to switch from using a `<table>` for layout to a better system; a grid of `<div>`s that we'll `float` next to one another.

# Setup

 1. Follow the [Getting Started with GitHub Guide](https://guides.firstdraft.com/getting-started-with-github.html) to download this code to your computer.
 1. Open the entire folder in Atom (on Windows, File > Open Folder; on Mac, it's just File > Open, but click Open while you have a folder selected rather than drilling in).
 1. Open `with_table.html` in Chrome; you can double-click it in Finder/Explorer, or File > Open in Chrome (Ctrl-O in Windows) and locate it.
 1. This was my solution to the homework. Study it and think up questions. CSS style rules are located in `our_styles.css`.
